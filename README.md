# Morphological Lexicon of the Greek New Testament

analysis and explanation of morphology of Greek New Testament and similar texts

A first pass has been done of all NT books to produce `lexemes.yaml`.

Currently (distinctly) working on...

 - projects/nominal_distinguishers

## Citation Form Patterns

 - projects/citation_forms

## Documenting Differences in Lemmatization

 - projects/lemmatization_differences

## Derivational Morphology

 - projects/derivational_morphology

## Principal Part Generation
