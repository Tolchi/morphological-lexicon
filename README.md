# Morphological Lexicon of the Greek New Testament

analysis and explanation of morphology of Greek New Testament and similar texts

A first pass has been done of all NT books to produce `lexemes.yaml`.

I'm now reviewing missing items, part-of-speech and lemma disagreements, doing
analysis of derivational and inflectional forms, and generating principal
parts.

Currently (distinctly) working on...

## Documenting Differences in Lemmatization

 - differences.yaml

## Derivation Morphology

 - nav_derivations.txt
 - scripts/nav_derivations.py


## Principal Part Generation

 - ending-paradigms.txt
 - scripts/check_endings.py
 - scripts/principal_parts.py
 - scripts/paradigm.py
