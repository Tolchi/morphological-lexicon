# Morphological Lexicon of the Greek New Testament

analysis and explanation of morphology of Greek New Testament and similar texts

A first pass has been done of all NT books to produce `lexemes.yaml`.

I'm now reviewing missing items, part-of-speech and lemma disagreements, and
doing analysis of derivational and inflectional forms.

Currently (distinctly) working on:

 - generate_differences.py
 - analyze_components.py
